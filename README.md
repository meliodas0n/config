# I own this

### let me explain what the fuck is going on here..

#### 1. .config -> contains folders that are supposed be on $HOME/.config(atleast some of them)
#### 2. .files -> these are files that starts with . and should be in $HOME.
#### 3. books.zip -> This has some books I believe, zipped because I don't have too much git.
#### 4. etc -> files that are should be in /etc/.
#### 5. install -> contains some of the scripts I wrote(forgive me if they suck!) helps in installing some of the tools/softwares I use.
#### 6. miscel -> some miscellaneous(i had to search for this spelling) stuff that I haven't decided to segregate them.
#### 7. ntoes -> some of the notes that I kept when trying to installing any softwares/tools/maybe be some code.
#### 8. rc -> contains rc files like .vimrc, .zshrc, .bashrc etc.,(including .bash_aliases).
#### 9. scripts -> these are some of the stuff I put in $HOME/.local/bin - cuz I want to use them on term.
#### 10. tool_settings -> (maybe this should be called as just 'settings' lmk on X if u ever see this) contains settings of tools like sublime, vscode, startship(ikr).
#### 11. walls -> wallpapers that I like to use most(I like them so fuck off if you don't).

### Most Importantly the Unsung hero of my setups **autosetup.sh**
#### This is supposed to install zero -> hyprland on ARCH and hyprland on UBUNUT
